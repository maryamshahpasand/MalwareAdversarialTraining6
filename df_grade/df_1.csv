<p><em>The response to the following 3 questions is your tutorial task for Week 1.</em></p>
<p><em>(1) Who is Silvia?</em></p>
<p><em>(2) How much is Silvia’s total asset?</em></p>
<p><em>(3) On what date was the suicide note modified?</em></p>
<h4>Software:</h4>
<p>The investigation was conducted using application Autopsy 4.3.0.</p>
<h4>Data analyzed:</h4>
<p>The object of the investigation was an image, named HandsOn01.E01, of the USB drive created using application the FTK Imager. It was performed by crime scene evidence technician in accordance with data acquisition procedure.</p>
<p>It was submitted for investigation by the detective assigned to the case of Sylvia’s death.</p>
<h4>Purpose of the investigation:</h4>
<p>To examine the image and identify any evidentiary artifacts that might relate to this case.</p>
<h4>Findings:</h4>
<p>The image contains only two files:<br />1) Text file<br />suicide1.txt - <strong>(Answer 3)</strong> This note was modified on 2002-11-22<br /><img src=""@@PLUGINFILE@@/suicide1.png"" alt=""Fig. 1 The 'suicide1.txt' file Properties."" width=""718"" height=""281"" /><br />The contents of the file:<br />“<br />I just can't go on any longer.

<h4><br />Conclusion:</h4>
<p><strong>(Answer 1)</strong><br />There is very little information on who Sylvia is.<br />The Text file content has name spelled with letter ‘Y’ in Sylvia as well as in the name of the Excel file “Sylvias Assets.xls”. However, the content of Excel file has the name “Silvia” spelled with character ‘i’ instead.</p>
<p>The Text file is named “suicide1” and the content, signed using name Sylvia, indicates a person in distress calling out for help.</p>
<p>The spreadsheet has a list of Silvia’s assets totaling $2,796,000.00 including a life insurance for a million dollars.</p>
